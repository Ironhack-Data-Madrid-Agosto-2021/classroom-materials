Hocus Pocus,Hip Hop ?,ferqwertyuiop,"[Intro]
That's what it is, uh huh
Nick Wiz, turn my headphones up, man
Uh, uh

[Hook]
Ayo, if you miss Hip-Hop, then stand up
Reminisce when this drop, get amped up
Any hit that's this hot is an anthem
Do ya' dance, love, she need a hand, breh
Lyricist that spit pop get stamped up
Hit or miss, then flip-flop, them clam up
They fearing this to hit blocks and slam clubs
Put yo' hands up, here ya' man come

[Verse 1]
Its mister word renowned with the best verse
One of the illest the streets, from the east to the west, heard
Get greeted with ghetto gestures like ""yessir""
A pre-meditated killer for the way I stretch words
Some of us love to flow 'til the club close
And some in love with blow for the love of dough
In it for fortune and fame, flamboyant for gurls
They extorting the game, exploiting the hood
Rappers ride for bread while the gossip spread
It's only hot cause we ride, spotted cops with feds
Plus, lots of heads go Pop instead
That's the word on the block is, ""Hip-Hop Is Dead""
So consumers quit copping, rappers flip-flopping
Artist pimped by they labels like a slave pick cotton
Pop Charts killing underground Hip-Hopers
While the world still looking for Ra like Bin Laden, let's go

[Hook]
Ayo, if you miss Hip-Hop, then stand up
Reminisce when this drop, get amped up
Any hit that's this hot is an anthem
Do ya' dance, love, she need a hand, breh
Lyricist that spit pop get stamped up
Hit or miss, then flip-flop, them clam up
They fearing this to hit blocks and slam clubs
Put yo' hands up, here ya' man come

[Verse 2]
Me and my dude's the new cool in the game
That Old-School feel with the New-School slang
The boomerang with the true duke flame
Shoot through yo' brain like smoking poom-shoong-pang
Ghetto galactic, the next level and back shit
Something like heroine, crack, mixed
The combination of Mike and Lebron, the life of a don
Yeah, just give the God the mic and it's on
My brand new vision gives you aneurisms
My fans'll listen, see my words like its camera's in 'em
We just anxious to bust like a new fo'-pound
So, the hood is reacquainted to the New York sound
Every verse is a mountain of proof, a man of my words
Even on the curb when I'm out of the booth
My style's the truth, unlimited amounts to produce
And my flow still tight when I'm about to get loose, let's go

[Hook]
Ayo, if you miss Hip-Hop, then stand up
Reminisce when this drop, get amped up
Any hit that's this hot is an anthem
Do ya' dance, love, she need a hand, breh
Lyricist that spit pop get stamped up
Hit or miss, then flip-flop, them clam up
They fearing this to hit blocks and slam clubs
Put yo' hands up, here ya' man come

[Verse 3]
The boogey-down, the buck-town mic flavor
I'm in yo' hoods like neighbors
Operation shut down, 0-60 like ""later""
It's rider, up-town, high-top, nike lacer
In the gut of the beast where they don't dwell
The gut of the streets but they don't sell
I still hold mics and stay so real
My flow tight with mo' sight's than AOL
I change climates like a plane pilot
Cause hurricanes and rain violent
Crack yo' skull, snatch yo' brain out it, uou out ya' mind if it ain't talent
And keep it out yo' rhymes if you ain't bought it
Raps tsunami, the track's behind me
Cats that try me, the raps too grimey
I rap a mami in black Armani
Clap with a body and tap punani

[Hook]
Ayo, if you miss Hip-Hop, then stand up
Reminisce when this drop, get amped up
Any hit that's this hot is an anthem
Do ya' dance, love, she need a hand, breh
Lyricist that spit pop get stamped up
Hit or miss, then flip-flop, them clam up
They fearing this to hit blocks and slam clubs
Put yo' hands up, here ya' man come"

Alls my life, I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life, I...
Hard times like, ""Yah!""
Bad trips like, ""Yah!""
Nazareth
I'm fucked up, homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow

Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Thundercat]
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers"

This struggle continues (x2)

[Chorus]
We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I want to jam it with you
We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I hope you like jamming too

[Bob Marley]
There is no rules, there is no vows we could do it anyhow
I and I will see you through
Because everyday we pay the price, with a living sacrifice
Jamming until the jam is through
We jamming, to think that jamming was a thing of the past
We jamming and I hope the jam is going to last

No bullet could stop us now, we neither beg nor we won't bow
Neither can't be bought nor sold
We all defend the right, Jah, Jah children must unite
Whose life is worth much more than gold

[Chorus]
Holy Mount Zion
Holy Mount Zion
Jah sitteth in Mount Zion
And rules all creation

[Bob Marley]
The mighty will te try, the truth it cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
Love that does exist, is the one the Lord presist
So jam by my side

[MC Lyte]
We jamming on the one for the daughters and sons
No the struggle is not over til the battle is won
Hip-Hop is life but it isn't all to me now
Where will we be if they take our mic from we
Or better yet strip us from life itself
They done-done it before so I sit behind the door
Those that claim but don’t really know the game
Bob Marley, know the man behind the name (yeah!)

[Chorus]

[MC Lyte]
J-A double M-I-N
We be jammin from Brooklyn down to Kingston
We be jammin in the name of the lord, sweet Allah
Without the blessings from above I ‘naw be no rap star
Exodus when i bust
See the struggle i must
Realize it ain't just
But whats next
On the cusp all soldiers at war
Steadily ignored
Still we ain't sure
What the battle is for
Years ago when we toured
Ready to explore
Entered through back doors
Treated like stink-manure
Spoke up for rights, we were cracked in the jaw
Elvis made a bundle while we remained poor (yes)
We remained poor
But we be jammin (yes)

[Bob Marley]
I and I will see you through

[MC Lyte]
We be jammin
Come a long way, but we still not there yet

[Bob Marley]
I and I will see you through

[MC Lyte]
The struggle continues

[Bob Marley]
Jam’s about my pride and truth I cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
True love that now exist is the love I can’t resist
So jam by my side
We’re jammin (we’re jammin)
And we’re jammin in the name of the lord (in the name of the lord)
We’re jammin (we’re jammin)
We’re jammin right straight god (from god)
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Yes, (Iya)
I and I will see you through
I and I will see you through
I and I will see you through

Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down

You know where I'm coming from
Though I am running to you

Yo no camelo perfumes de Nina Ricci
Soy más de libros de la Silvia Federici
Será mejor que trates mejor a esas bitches
No sea que de repente me escuchen y se compinchen
Os lo tengo dicho, os lo dejo hecho
Al punto, la teoría King Kong no apunta
Facilito tronco, deja de poner impedimentos
Deja de ser un experimento
Déjame ser otra cosa que no sea un cuerpo
Deja de follarme con los ojos ya de paso
Cuando paso por la calle sola en todo momento
Porque me cago en to'
Yo, en pleno siglo veintiuno
Que tenga que venir la Ana a rebatir a Freud
La tradición es larga desde Nietzsche hasta Unamuno
De Aristóteles a Darwin, desde Franco hasta Rajoy
De aquellos barros, estos lodos, sé por dónde voy
Que las cosas no han cambia'o demasiado a día de hoy
Haciendo make it rain a lo Hard Candy
Modus operandi, raya'os, estampa'os rollo punky

[Interludio]
Eres la puerta del demonio
Eres la que quebró el sello de aquel árbol prohibido
Eres la primera desertora de la ley divina
Eres la que convenció a aquel a quien el diablo no fue suficiente para atacar
Así de fácil destruiste la imagen de Dios y el hombre
A causa de tu deserción, mujer
[Verso 2]
Que venga Dios y lo vea
Como a Gea se la marginó
Ardió en la hoguera con tres brujas durante la Inquisición
Vale, que monten sus ministros festivales feministas contra la segregación
Alimentando el tópico con discriminación
Positiva que es mentira, no es ninguna solución
Yo hago lo que quiero bajo el ""Niña no andes sola""
Mujer en toda regla, poetisa con mayúscula
Descontrolá por la ciudad cantando hardcore
Con camisa y tacones altos
Con la moral muy por encima de sus cuentos
Como la de otras tantas putas que mueren callando

Corre ve y dile a aquel que no vamos a ser tan dóciles
Imbéciles se creen que son la élite caerán
Por su propio peso cuando rescate a Eurídice
Lapídame, humíllame, si quieres ponme un burka
Arráncame la voz y el clítoris pa' ser más pulcra
Escóndeme, tápame bien ese escote impuro
No sea que te pervierta o te transporte al lado oscuro
No sea que te intoxique con mi psique de cianuro

Diciendo que la mujer, si no es prostituta es tonta
Pero si es que no es ninguna de las dos, lo que sí está seguro es que es mala

O que nos santificamos cuando llegamos a ser madres

You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean

They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children, zip it, listen

Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise

At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
Saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

Berri Txarrak,Katedral Bat,1132937644,"Gitarra astindu
Eta ikusi kanturik baduen hor nonbait ezkutuan
Behatzak bihurritu
Ea norbaitek ahaztua duen akorde minorren bat

Eta min eman arte zure falta izan
Ez da musa hoberik

Katedral bat egin hegalik gabe sortu ziren
Abesti pusketekin
Bertako beiratetik sartzen diren eguzki izpien
Energiaz berrekin

Eta min eman arte zure falta izan
Ez da musa hoberik
Ikasitakoa desikasten ikasi
Ahaztutakoa ahaztu eta aurrera egin

“Irakurtzea da bestela idaztea”
Paperak aitortzen dit
“kantatu besterik ez nuen egin nahi”
Erantzuten diot nik

Neure ahotsa bilatu, beti besteena entzun
Loa kentzen didanari ekintzekin erantzun
Lagunarteko uneak luzarazi
Maitasuna egin maite dugunekin
Carpe noctem!

Eta min eman arte zure falta izan
Ez da musa hoberik
Bihotzen artean parkour egitean erori
Baina beti zutik erori

Gitarra laztandu barruan kanturik baduen…"

You say ""I love you, boy""
I know you lie
I trust you all the same
I don't know why

Cause when my back is turned
My bruises shine
Our broken fairytale
So hard to hide

[Pre-Chorus]
I still believe it's you and me 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
When we collide we come together
If we don't we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise; I know you're worth it
When you hit me hit me hard

[Verse 2]
Sitting in a wishing hole
Hoping it stays dry
Feet cast in solid stone
I've got Gilligan's eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I still believe it's you and me 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
When we collide we come together
If we don't we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise; I know you're worth it
When you hit me hit me hard

You said love was letting us go against what
Our future is for...
Many of horror
Our future's for many of horror

Di que ves, dime que ves
Si hay algo
Un manantial breve y fugaz
Entre las manos
Toca afinar, definir el trazo
Sintonizar, reagrupar pedazos
A mi colección de medallas
Y de arañazos
Ya está aquí, quien lo vio
Bailar como un lazo en un ventilador
Quien iba a decir, que sin carbón
No hay reyes magos
Aún quedan vicios por perfeccionar
En los días raros
Nos destaparemos en la intimidad
Con la punta del zapato
Ya está aquí, quien lo vio
Bailar como un lazo en un ventilador
Quien iba a decir, que sin borrón
No hay trato
El futuro se vistió
Con el traje nuevo del emperador
Quien iba a decir que sin carbón
No hay reyes magos

Regalos por abrir
Monedas que al girar
Descubran un perfil
Y empieza el celofán
Y acaba en eco"

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one

She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he'll be satisfied
Is when he's all drunk

Oh, mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

What about you?
How's your mental? How do you cope with what you been through?
How's your tempo?

Peddle my mind later, washin' the whip
See my reflection, it's all in the paint
Laid back top, bumping that Frank Ocean, ""Crack Rock""

Been through it all, I'm no stranger to loss

Mon Band,Quimica Brutal,soyungalgo,"[Letra ""Desorden""]

[Intro: Sample; Lom-C]
Hay alguna idea original en mi cabeza
La vida son dos días, necesito vivirlos al máximo
Hoy es el primer día del resto de mi vida
(desorden, desorden)
Soy un tópico ambulante
Debería empezar a correr otra vez ocho kilómetros al día
Pero hacerlo de verdad o hacer escalada
Tengo que dar un giro en mi vida
¿Qué tengo que hacer?
Tengo que leer más, cultivarme
Y si aprendiera KungFu, yo qué sé o tocar un instrumento
Podría aprender chino, eso sería brutal ¡que ridículo!

Ser auténtico, una persona segura
¿Por qué debería creer que tengo que pedir perdón por existir? Quizás sea la química cerebral
Quizás eso es lo que me pasa, una alteración química
Todos mis problemas y mi ansiedad
Podrían deberse a un desequilibrio químico
O a una serie de sinapsis defectuosas...
Tengo que hacérmelo mirar

[Verso 1: Lom C]
Hace tiempo que escribo para ordenar tanto silencio
Tiempo que no vivo, sólo hablo con el viento
Tardes de prisión calculando cada huida
Tanta depresión, tantas lágrimas vertidas
Mi corazón se hizo de piedra, luché sin ganas
Mirando con el alma el drama el día de mañana
Nada volverá me susurro en un cuaderno
Cada soledad de invierno me hizo ser eterno

El vidente que no ve, adivina, pero olvida
El último druida que ya se bebió su vida
Ebrio de ansiedad en el libro de mis párrafos
A ratos resucito, escribo libre en este páramo

Cabeza entre las nube, es el lema que me guía
Las cosas que escribo son ciencia, pura mercancía
A veces soy el agua, otras veces sólo prendo
Chispas, se queman mis frases y ni me sorprendo

Carismas sobre el folio, en la calle… nada nuevo
De tanto esperar me marché y regresaré de nuevo
El ciclo de los sueños rotos, la misma foto
El álbum donde toco el caos cada vez que exploto

Música para las mentes, ponte este sonido, vente
Soy el Edén de los actos inconscientes
Saltos al vacío de las líneas que me dan vida
Una salida y unas cartas al presente

Sentado en la nada que creo, mi mausoleo
Cada tempestad es brisa si luego te veo
Rapeo mis deseos en el mar de la angustia
Levanto mi trofeo y mis taras ante la industria
Harto de saber que mis manos sí trabajan
Harto de buscar dinero en lo que me relaja
Mastico la tensión de vivir encadenado
A esta libertad de esclavo que yo me he creado

Dado que mi tiempo no está, pero se gasta
Dado que la gente aplasta y si no, te subasta
Ya ni en mí confío; soy amor, pero con frío
El alma de otro crío en este futuro sombrío

Un zombi cotidiano, meridiano de su esfera social
Donde viven fieras de lo irracional
MC de días grises en la era de la luz
Vendaval que nos consume a todos ¿qué me dices tú?

Un camino, no veo el final, pero lo intuyo
¿Qué le voy hacer si todo lo que tengo es tuyo?
Escribo por necesidad, no sé si me entiendes
Si no se moriría de hambre el corazón que siente

Dentro de este folio se anula lo material
Ahí fuera todo es diferente y sale mi instinto animal
Paseo en laberintos por el mal del hombre
Poseo algo distinto, lo tengo y no sé dónde

Éste es mi desorden, desorbitados cuentos
Fragmentos limitados del dolor que me invento
Si tengo que morir, que sea tarde y contigo
Si tengo que sufrir, que sea por lo que no digo
Un abrazo, un llanto; polos casi opuestos
El día, la noche, un gesto y este Rap honesto
Maestro de aprender que no sé casi nada
Así consigo ser alguien nuevo cada mañana

Levanto de la cama por orgullo y por tus besos
Redacto cada nuevo escrito, repito el proceso
Me siento encerrado en esta vida que no sé dónde lleva
Quizás mañana pueda o quizás no estaré

Lo asumo, pero me consumo, lento como gas
La llama que me quema es humo y ya no aguanto más
Eso es lo que siento, pero sé que se irá
Como sé que recordar es ira y yo soy espiral

Una y otra vez dando vueltas a lo mismo
Lo llamareis rutina, yo lo llamo inconformismo
Soy como esa pieza que no encaja, pero quiere
Ser igual al resto aunque sabe que así se muere

Ya no pido nada, ya no busco, solo estoy
Mis ojos no te ven aunque te miren y así voy
La mente en las alturas, más grande es la caída
Vivo a oscuras, déjame que antes me despida

Esta noche todo pasará, como siempre
Mañana Dios dirá si es que vive en occidente
Ciudades son empresas, vida es el producto
Ponerme las esposas ya, será lo más justo

Mi crimen fue soñar y esperar que mis sueños
Un día se cumplieran, ¡pobre niño ingenuo!
Ahora ni me adapto ni quiero ser abstracto
Saco otro proyecto y no me importará el impacto

Llevo mucho tiempo resumiendo lo que siento
Si no sonara bien, menuda pérdida de tiempo
Sólo sé hacer esto (sí) Fuera del papel
Soy un desperdicio ingenuo, otro perro fiel

Pero cuando escribo no, no existen bozales
Vine a destrozarles con palabras que son miel
Dulce manantial que me riega por dentro
Así vivo contento y me tatúo la piel

[Outro: Sample; Lom-C]
Desorden
No me saques del papel. para lo demás soy torpe
Desorden
No me saques del papel, para lo demás soy torpe

No me saques del papel, para lo demás soy torpe

Doctor's in, I'm popping medicine
Prescription fixin' me right up until I get it in
Oxygen, until the shock sets in
My body's shaking, flatlined baby 'til she walks in

[Verse 2]
Lay me back and plug her in
She brings me back to high school, babe (I think I'm fittin' in)
All white, the devil in disguise
I think I need to check my eyes
Was catching feelings for the guys
Paging the nurse to change my mind

[Chorus]
I need a doctor, that's what they tell me
Shot up to heaven, living hell inside my body
They operatin', I think I'm changin'
But every time he passes by, I'm thinking (Doctor?)

I know this boy who makes me feels kinda funny
Kinda weird, I want his hands on my body
Tell the doctor, this feels wrong
Change my ways and play along
Change the way I walk and talk
Take some pills and pray to God
Find a way to make this stop
Hook me up to IV drop
Watch me all around the clock
If that don't work, give me a shock

Now, doctor doctor
I know you've got to see
That all my love, joy, and innocence
Was pulled from under me
And I know
That it's real late but I was up just wondering
If you had a few more pills for me I still can't get to sleep
Thinkin' bout him
Thinkin' bout her
And I'm thinking that if I keep thinkin'
This shit will never occur, so
I ring my bell
I drop my gown
I said, now nurse come here
And take my ass to town
Oh, help me

I need a doctor, that's what they tell me
Shot up to heaven, living hell inside my body

I bought a Moncler coat for the times we were broke
I'ma wear it in the summer on LeBron James boat
Front row? Duh, bro, we don't sit on nosebleeds
Ain't your pockets obese? They won't fit in those seats
Ayy, we like a cold team, nigga, Shaq and Kobe
Like back in '03, I was only like 6
Shit, I was like 16, but I can give a sixteen
I can make a bitch scream, that's a bit extreme
I got a thick bald bitch, I call her Ms. Clean
My drip frosty like Halls and Listerine
We all all-stars, you hardly sixth string
Yeah, I had to ball hard to harvest these dreams
Swear to God, me too, no Harvey Weinstein
The coupe was lime green, my wrist was blinding
We party in South Beach, Ferraris and blue cheese
Fuck does that even mean? Nigga, just let the hook sing
[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
One of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me
Ooh, not one of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat

Puso un baile un jutía, para una gran diversión
De timbalero un ratón, que alegraba el
Campo un día
Un gato también venía, elegante y placentero
'Buenas noches, compañero'

'Para alguien aquí poder tocar
Para descansar un poco'
Salió el ratón medio loco
'también voy a descansar'
Y el gato en su buen bailar, bailaba un
Danzón liviano

Bien placentero:

You spoke with broken speech

Stomping our feet on the wooden boards
Never gotta worry about locking the door

You could say 'I do' at least

Las hermanas mellizas Victoria y Soledad
Son el santo grial del Rock and Roll animal
No son una fantasía, ni son una realidad

Una sola vez vi juntas a Victoria y Soledad
Y nos dimos un gran beso en honor a la verdad
Parecían la canción de Randy Newman sin la coca
Las dos eran demasiado pero una no era poca

Y frente al mar voy a recordar lo que no fue
Pero espero encontrarlas otra vez alguna vez
Casi las tuve en un abrazo a las dos
Pero no hubo lugar para el amor de a tres

No tengo corazon pero te digo la verdad
Las mellizas eran lo mejor de la ciudad
Hubiera sido lo más triple que se puede pedir

No basta con vivir
Quiero mi parte de Victoria y Soledad

Estoy buscando algo que no voy a encontrar
A Victoria y Soledad cuando se van

Un año de Victoria y Soledad (x2)
Un año...
Victoria y Soledad y no Sofía y Realidad

[Verso 1]
En la vida conocí mujer igual a la Flaca
Coral negro de la Habana, tremendísima mulata
Cien libras de piel y hueso, cuarenta kilos de salsa
Y en la cara dos soles, que sin palabras hablan
Que sin palabras hablan

La Flaca duerme de día, dice que así el hambre engaña
Y cuando cae la noche baja a bailar a la tasca
Y bailar y bailar, y tomar y tomar
Una cerveza tras otra pero ella nunca engorda
Pero ella nunca engorda

[Coro]
Por un beso de la Flaca daría lo que fuera
Por un beso de ella, aunque sólo uno fuera
Por un beso de la Flaca daría lo que fuera
Por un beso de ella, aunque sólo uno fuera
Aunque sólo uno fuera

[Verso 2]
Mojé mis sábanas blancas, como dice la canción
Recordando las caricias que me brindó el primer día
Y enloquezco de ganas de dormir a su ladito
Porque ¡Dios! que esta flaca a mí me tiene loquito
O-oh, a mí me tiene loquito
[Coro]
Por un beso de la Flaca  daría lo que fuera
Por un beso de ella, aunque sólo uno fuera
Por un beso de la Flaca daría lo que fuera
Por un beso de ella, aunque sólo uno fuera

[Outro]
Aunque sólo uno fuera
Aunque sólo uno fuera
Aunque sólo uno fuera
Aunque sólo uno fuera
Aunque sólo uno fuera
Aunque sólo uno fuera
Aunque sólo uno fuera
Aunque sólo uno fuera
Aunque sólo uno fuera
Aunque sólo uno fuera
Aunque sólo uno fuera
Aunque sólo uno fuera
Aunque sólo uno fuera
Aunque sólo uno fuera"

Hated the most, so I keep my haters close
Let 'em know I want the smoke
So much bread I gotta boast
This burner turn you into toast
I'm so G, I don’t keep that pistol on me
Ay, I'll beat yo ass you try to press that issue on me
Ay, I keep a stash under all these zippers on me
I got bitches blowin' like I got a whistle on me

Tatted on my choker
Shoppin' sprees at Dover

Slap me if I’m sober
Yea, yea, yea, come over
Fucked two girls that looked like Tina Fey and Amy Poehler

Back shot, back shot, back shot, back shot, right behind the backdrop
Can’t stop, can’t stop, can’t stop, can’t stop turnin' up like mascots
Matlock, Matlock, Matlock, Matlock want me in them padlocks
I hope you got a plan, catch me if you can hoe

[Verse 2]
Yea hoe, can’t get jammed hoe, I’ll be damned hoe
Yea hoe, I’m the man hoe, from the Land hoe
Yea hoe, out them bandos, to these bands hoe
Sandals for my fam though - 3, 2, 1, takeoff
Jets round the world with them
And you know we gotta fly with the herb with them
In the town, I’m a chief like turbo and them
Shouts for the flow G Herbo and them
I just got the cell phone workin' again
I just got the styrofoam purple again
Never make threats non-verbal again
You already know how I'm lurkin' again

Fuel Fandango,Toda la vida,ferqwertyuiop,"Toda la vida coleccionado mil amores
Haciendo juegos malabares
Para no amarte en exclusiva
Toda la vida poniendo trampas al orgullo
Tantas historias como estrellas
Para no ser esclavo tuyo
Para obtener mi propia musica
Toda la vida descubriendo puertas a escondidas
Para escapar de tus heridas
Para buscar la aventuras que me liberen de tus besos
Solo por eso, solo por eso
Toda la vida para olvidate
Para perderte y recuprate
Y no dormirme en tus sentidos
Como un idiota enamorado desmadejado
Aburrido que se conforma
Toda la vida marcando numeros secretos
Mandando cartas a escondidas
Haciendo citasindiscretas
Como un romantico suicida, un suicidas
Toda la vida sabiendo siempre que me esperas
Siempre segura de ti misma
Siempre mujer siempre perfecta
Y yo buscando mi otra musica, mi propia musica
En me musica aaah
Toda la vida pensando siempre en tu egoismo
Y por no ser esclavo tuyo
Soy el esclavo de mi mismo
Toda la vida tirando amor por por todos lados
Dejando beso enganchados
En cada nueva despedida
Y tu al final la mas querida

[Estrofa 1]
¿Recuerdas cómo era este amor salvaje?
Dormía en las alfombras, bebía de tu boca
Nunca pudimos ponerle un bozal y pasear
Siempre mordía justo después de besar

[Estribillo]
Llévame a bailar como si aún fuera real
Como si aún fuéramos ese animal
Como si el mundo no se fuera acabar
Como si el universo no tuviera un plan
Aunque quiera llorar, tú solo llévame a bailar

[Estrofa 2]
Este amor insomne comía nuestra mano
Corría desnudo, follaba sin descanso
Nunca pudimos domesticarlo ni acariciar
Cielo ebullendo al intentarlo atar

Llévame a bailar como si aún fuera real
Como si aún fuéramos ese animal
Como si el mundo no se fuera acabar
Como si el universo no tuviera un plan
Aunque quiera llorar, tú solo llévame a bailar

Nosotros que creíamos que éramos irrompibles
No escuchamos el tic tac, vivíamos al límite

No escuchamos el tic tac, tic tac, tic tac, tic tac, tic tac

Could you hear death's voice within the breeze?
The atmosphere is hurting with disease
But you're too busy with your head down
Your mind's not here
There's a child filled with fear
Begging you to hear their hurting is severe
But you're too busy with your head down

[Pre-Chorus]
¿Por qué siempre se tiene que sufrir?
Trae tanto dolor solamente existir

[Chorus]
The universe is screaming
In desperatе need of healing
The love wе choose not to feed
Will lead us to our own defeat
The hurting just need loving
The world around us is dying
No, no, no
But you're too busy with your head down

The tree of song sings its sorrow
For humankind
It's all right in front of plain sight

[Verso 1]
Fue esta mañana al despertar
Cuando me llego un acorde fatal
Sellaste el pasaporte al Nunca Jamás, tú
Me sale gritar un ""no""
Hermano de hambre, mi héroe del Baix
Tu alma sigue intacta en ese local
Pero la línea que muy pocos quieren cruzar
Tú la saltaste hoy
Con qué noticia empiezo, oh, no

[Verso 2]
Hablé con tu ángel de la guarda
Justo el alba dimitió
Sin la opinión de Dios
Ahora trabaja en un gran parking
Me quejé de su actitud
Me dijo: ""¿Dónde estabas tú?""

[Estribillo]
Si me preguntan diré:
""Nada, él soñó con ser nada
Una gota en el agua
Fundida en un mar de adiós""
Si no se callan diré:
""Nadie, él soñó con ser nadie
Más ligero que el aire
Sin peso de aquel dolor""
Con qué noticia empiezo hoy
[Verso 3]
Te suspendiste en el vacío aunque nadie puntuó
Ya siento el aire de tus alas
No estás y aún cuentas
Y a tan pocos puedo hablarles de ti
Que tengo el alma congelada

[Estribillo]
Si me preguntan diré:
""Nada, él soñó con ser nada
Una gota en el agua
Fundida en un mar de adiós""

Sin peso de aquel dolor""

¿Hay más?
Si lo sabes, di si hay más
Más allá de mi rabia
O si la vida es un viaje heroico hacia la nada
No hay más
Antes te hice una carta
Pero sé que al cantar, es una invocación"

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

I saw you creeping around the garden; what are you hiding?
I beg your pardon, don't tell me ""nothing""
I used to think that I could trust you
I was your woman
You were my knight and shining companion

To my surprise
My love's demise
Was his own greed
And lullabies

With your big eyes
And your big lies

And your big lies

I noticed you got hot in summer
You had no comfort
Your shirt was cotton
Your face was sunburned
You paced around like you'd been waiting
Waiting for something
Your world was burning and I stood watching
[Pre-Chorus]
As I looked on
The flames grew high
You watched me frown
I said ""goodbye""

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

Is it me, was I wrong to have trusted you?
Did I see what I wanted, what wasn't true?
Was I wrong to go on like a little fool?

Say, me say many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
I get mad frustrated when I rhyme
Thinkin' of all them kids that try to do this for all the wrong reasons
Seasons change, mad things rearrange
But it all stays the same like the love doctor, strange
I'm tame like the rapper, get red like a snapper when they do that
Got your whole block saying ""True dat""
If only they knew that it was you who was irregular
Sold your soul for some secular muzak that's wack
Plus you use that loop over and over
Claiming that you got a new style, your attempts are futile
Ooh, child, you puerile, brain waves are sterile
You can't create, you just wait to take my tapes (Bing)
Laced with malice, hands get calloused
From gripping microphones from here to Dallas
Go ask Alice if you don't believe me, I get in her visions like Stevie
See me ascend from the chalice like the weed be
Indeed we like Khalid Muhammad, MCs make me vomit
I get controversial, freak your style with no rehearsal
Au contraire mon frère, don't you even go there
Me without a mic is like a beat without a snare
I dare to tear into your ego
We go way back like some ganja and pelequo
Or ColecoVision, my rhymes make incisions in your anatomy
And I'll back this with Deuteronomy
Or Leviticus, God made this word, you can't get with this
Sweet like licorice, dangerous like syphilis, yeah

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean, Wyclef Jean & Lauryn Hill]
How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do I rip on the daily?

How many mics do you rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
I used to be underrated, now I take iron
Makes my shit constipated, I'm more concentrated
So on my day off, with David Sonenberg I play golf
Run through Crown Heights screaming out, ""Mazel tov!""
Problem with no man, before Black, I'm first human
Appetite to write like Frederick Douglass with a slave hand (Bing)
Street pressure, word to papa, I ain't goin' under
One day I'll have a label and make deals with Tommy Mottola
Mama always told me, ""You're one in a million""
Always watch your back, never tangle with Haitian Sicilians
Now I got a record deal, ""How does it feel?""
I'm never gonna survive unless I get crazy like Seal
'Cause the whole world's out of order
So at night, the fiends dance on grease with John Travolta
One got slaughtered as he coughed blood from his mouth
The other tried to duck and caught a left with my Guinness Stout
Brother, brother, can't you get this through your head?
This is set up by the feds, they're scoping us with their infrareds

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean, Wyclef Jean & Lauryn Hill]
How many mics do you rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do I rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many

[Verse 3: Pras]
Too many MCs, not enough mics
Exit your show like I exit the turnpike
Dice and dynamite like Dolemite
Double-deuce delight, I don't Dick Van Dyke
Star light to star bright, the freaks come out at night
Like my man Wyclef (I wear my sunglasses at night)
And my panache will mosh your entourage
Squash the squad and hide their bodies under my garage
And when the cops come lookin, I be bookin' to Brooklyn
Leave the trails broken, flippin' tokens to Hoboken
A clean getaway like Alec Baldwin
Driving in my fast car playing Tracy Chapman

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Lauryn Hill]
How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Say, me say many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do you rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do we rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many mics do I rip on the daily?
Many, money, say, me say many, many, many

You've seen your future bride
Yeah, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting and

[Chorus]
The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Well, don't you always do the same?
It's what you're there for, don't you know?

[Verse 2]
The lights are flashing
Down in here tonight
And some might exchange a glance
But keep pretending to dance
Don't act like it's not happening
As if it's impolite
To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same as they all do
And hope for the best
[Chorus]
The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Well, don't you always do the same?
It's what you’re there for, but no

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Get on your dancing shoes
You sexy little swine
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through
I said, the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride, yeah
Yeah, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting"

Baby, I can't wait to know
Believe me, I'll always be there, so

[Verse 1]
Though I know I love you
I find it hard to see how you feel about me
'Cause I don't understand you
Oh, you are yet to learn how to speak
When we first met, I will never forget
'Cause even though I didn't know you yet
We were bound together, then and forever
And I could never let you go

[Chorus]
Baby, I can't wait to know
What do you think about things?
Believe me, I will always be there, so
You can tell me anything and I'll listen

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
When we are together
There isn't anywhere that I would rather be
Three birds of a feather
I just hope you enjoy our company
It's been some time and though hard to define
As if the stars have started to align
We are bound together, now and forever
And I will never let you go

[Chorus]
Baby, I can't wait to know
What do you think about things?
Believe me, I will always be there, so
You can tell me anything and I'll listen

[Bridge]
I might even know what to say
But either way
At least I'll be
There!

[Chorus]
Baby, I can't wait to know
What do you think about things?
Believe me, I will always be there, so
You can tell me anything and I'll listen"

""Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me""
You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it, friend, it's on its head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

[Chorus]
Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles

[Verse 2]
Third and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me ""Lip Parade""
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

[Pre-Chorus]
And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

[Chorus]
Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles

[Verse 3]
Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright
Above my brother, I, and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now, to know it in my memory

[Pre-Chorus]
And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

[Chorus]
High above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles"
Al Green,Take Me to the River,11124266126,"[Verse 1]
I don't know why I love her like I do
All the changes you put me through
Take my money, my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, can you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

[Chorus]
Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Take me to the river, dip me in the water
Washing me down, washing me down

[Verse 2]
I don't know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the things that we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I would never regret

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, can you tell me?
Am I in love to stay?

[Chorus]
Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Push me in the river, dip me in the water
Washing me down, washing me
[Bridge]
Hug me, squeeze me, love me, tease me
Till I can't, till I can't, I can't take no more

[Chorus]
Dip me in the water, drop me in the river
Push me in the water, drop me in the river
Washing me down, washing me down

[Verse 3]
I don't know why I love her like I do
All the trouble you put me through
Sixteen candles there on my wall
And here am I, the biggest fool of them all

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, can you tell me?
Am I in love to stay?

[Chorus]
Take me to the river, drop me in the water
Dip me in the river, drop me in the water
Washing me down, washing me down
Ooh, a-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya

Ooh, a na na na
A na na na na, ah!

Ha! Na na na na, ah!

I'm that mothafuckin mane
With the silver mane
Game changed
Grain, on everything you see my face on I am not the same
I'm that level 11 mage, with no lock on my rage
I wanted to spread the meaning of life so I got it tatted on my
Face
I used to give a fuck about the love I was getting from bitches
Now I only smile when a bitch asphyxiating
I'm deaf to kids who criticize me but have a day job they hate
Bitch, go lay in traffic and wait for something to flatten your fuckin' face
I was broke and sad
Now I'm rich and sad
The discontent I have ain't got no price tag, ayy
Money don't mean shit, fuck all of the racks, ayy
Bitches treat me different now I'm over that, yeah
I never saw a demon till I met a label rep
I'm Blackmage till I die fuck all of the rest, yeah
I fell in love in Prague till I went to Budapest
I'm tryna see the earth then die, fuck retirement, yeah

[Outro]
On the way
To an early grave
Just like everyone I know but we cannot be saved, ayy
I'm the mage
King of sodomy
Open up the portal into Hades, then I'll leave, yeah
Don't you pray
For me, I believe
In a cause and effect universe, give and receive, ayy
Alchemy
Mental alchemy
Is the only way to live on the physical plane"

Calavera,No te das cuenta,soyungalgo,"[Letra de ""No Te Das Cuenta""]

[Verso 1]
Mira lo que has hecho otra vez
Te has equivocado otra vez
Y te has castigado otra vez
Pero no te das cuenta
No te das cuenta
Lo divertido que es

[Verso 2]
Mira lo que hicieron de ti
Otro ciervo más del redil
Mira lo que hiciste de mí ¿o es que no te das cuenta?
No te das cuenta..
Solo repites que...
Hoy te amenaza la realidad al otro extremo de tu alegría
Ya no es momento para intentar que el sueño dure toda la vida

[Estribillo]
Mira lo que has hecho otra vez
Mira lo que has hecho otra vez
Mira lo que has hecho otra vez
Mira lo que has hecho otra vez"
