Mama Jarana,Vuelta a Casa,soyungalgo,"[Verso 1: Seth Condrey]
Vagando por el mundo, buscando algo más
Que pueda darle vida a toda esta oscuridad
Vi a la distancia una gran señal
Despierta mi esperanza, ya no vuelvo atrás
Ya no vuelvo atrás

[Coro: Seth Condrey]
A mi puerta Él llamó
Su gracia me levantó
No me puedo escapar
Rendido estoy
De vuelta a casa voy

[Verso 2: Seth Condrey]
Mi fuerza en la prueba, la fuente de mi fe
O cada día nueva su misericordia es
Todo es perdonado, lo viejo muerto está
Él me ha salvado, Su amor me llevará
Hasta el final

[Coro: Seth Condrey]
A mi puerta Él llamó
Su gracia me levantó
No me puedo escapar
Rendido estoy
De vuelta a casa voy
[Puente: Andy Alemany]
En la casa de mi Padre, quiero siempre estar
Sentado en Su mesa libre de toda maldad
Me pude haber perdido pero Él me rescató
Llevándome de vuelta a Su gran amor, a Su gran amor
A Su gran amor

[Coro: Seth Condrey]
A mi puerta Él llamó
Su gracia me levantó
No me puedo escapar
Rendido estoy
De vuelta voy
A mi puerta Él llamó
Su gracia me levantó
No me puedo escapar
Rendido estoy
De vuelta a casa, vuelta a casa voy"

Bebé
Solo mirame a la cara, si me mientes
Da igual
Porque sabes que me cato, aunque lo intentes
Estoy
Cruzando sin mirar, con ganas de quemar la ciudad
Pensando que no estás con ganas de quemaaar

[Intense instrumental]

[Coro: Pedro La Droga]
Llevo toda la noche sin pensar en ti
Me está viniendo de locos que ya no estés aquí
Y ahora, de mañaneo
Veo tus mensajes, pero no los leo
Llevo toda la noche pensando en ti
Me está rayando dеmasiao' saber que estoy pa' ti
Y si sе acaba el mamoneo
Quiero escribirte pero me tiemblan los dedos

Eo, eo

[Verso: Inner cut]
Tu y yo, fallo de conexión
Me reinicias la sesión
Pero aguanto el dolor, mejor
Solo, estoy mejor
So let me be alone, eh eh
Yo ya no sé ni cuanto llevo en madrid
Pero to' los días pienso en ti
Me duele a morir
Cada vez que paso por allí
Me acuerdo de to'
Solo me quiero a mi
Solo quiero destruir
Eh eh eh!

[Coro: Pedro La Droga]
Llevo toda la noche sin pensar en ti
Me está viniendo de locos que ya no estés aquí
Y ahora, de mañaneo
Veo tus mensajes, pero no los leo
Llevo toda la noche pensando en ti
Me está rayando demasiao' saber que estoy pa' ti
Y si se acaba el mamoneo
Quiero escribir pero me tiemblan los dedos"
ELYELLA,Todo Lo Que Importa,soyungalgo,"[Estribillo: Swan Fyahbwoy]
Solo dime si estoy, hoy, otro día igual
O si vas a abandonar esa espiral
Y el tiempo que estoy, hoy, dejo de pensar
Porque todo lo que importa es respirar
Y como el aire me voy, hoy, lejos del dolor
Vuelo por el cielo solo y sin motor
Sé bien lo que soy, hoy, no tengo otra opción
Yo le hablo directo al corazón
Ooohhh

[Estrofa I: Swan Fyahbwoy]
Yo no sé ni por que empecé
Encontré una melodía, desahogué mi rabia y lo grabé
Nunca pensé en qué pasará
Mi cabeza lucha por sobrevivir y no descansará
Me lancé y me dejé llevar
He nadado en aguas claras y con piedras me volví a chocar
De mil formas lo puedes ver
Pero mirando de lejos sé que no lo vas a comprender
Yo era otro chico sin futuro
Casi sin regalo en navidad porque no había un puto duro
Viví por tantos vecindarios
Y en la música encontré el refugio que no me dio ningún barrio
Por hacerlo diferente
Por llegar a gente y trabajar como un demente
Por sacar la rabia y el amor nadando contra la corriente me ves
Y lo que ya grabé quedará siempre
Hoy, que lo pasado me hace ser como soy
Aunque he viajado y aun no se a donde voy
Y se me pasan los días
Y yo solo ando pensando en que siempre que veis
Que pasa una oportunidad y no cogéis
Y que el trabajo nadie hace por la face
Y siempre pasa lo mismo
Y pongo fe en que el futuro es presente, es el hoy
[Estribillo: Swan Fyahbwoy]
Voy, otro día igual
O si vas a abandonar esa espiral
Y el tiempo que estoy, hoy, dejo de pensar
Porque todo lo que importa es respirar
Y como el aire me voy, hoy, lejos del dolor
Vuelo por el cielo solo y sin motor
Sé bien lo que soy, hoy, no tengo otra opción
Yo le hablo directo al corazón
Ooohhh

[Estrofa II: Zatu]
Nunca dejaré de ser un niño
Hablo con Dios, vengo del simio
Cumpliré con creces mi designio
Plantándole mis huevos a la quimio
Se saco un cúter de la manga y lo esgrimió
Y me pinchó, primo, apuñaló a este genio
Firmé mi normativa y mi convenio
Y pase a la nueva liga, juego en senior
Miro la vida de otro modo
Si lo grabamos juntos codo a codo, vale, lo hago, si no no colaboro
Sobrevivo contando mis miserias
Y lo corto que es el paso de algo trágico a comedia
Y lo hago mirando un Sony Xperia
La mente sobre la materia
Si tía, yo no entono melodías
Pero escribo cosas serias, tocar fibra es lo que impera hoy día
Después de colabos y ferias, Swan
El primer tema que hacemos a medias
Sin prejuicio al escribir
Y con el lema mas valiente: Sin Miedo a Vivir
Así que ¿quién le convenciera y le sacara de esa cáscara?
La vida emite facturas mas caras, ya se rascará
Nadie es mas que nadie, y algo es algo, que es mejor que ná'
La misma mirada con los palos, algo más que más
[Estribillo: Swan Fyahbwoy]
Voy, hoy, otro día igual
O si vas a abandonar esa espiral
Y el tiempo que estoy, hoy, dejo de pensar
Porque todo lo que importa es respirar
Y como el aire me voy, hoy, lejos del dolor
Vuelo por el cielo solo y sin motor
Sé bien lo que soy, hoy, no tengo otra opción
Yo le hablo directo al corazón
Ooohhh"
Shinova,El Álbum,soyungalgo,"[Letra de ""El Álbum""]

[Verso 1]
Tu rostro lo tengo fijado
En el lado de adentro de mis párpados
Tu recuerdo resuena como un eco
En mi jardín subterráneo de orquídeas

[Pre-Coro]
Tu ausencia me está abriendo un hueco
En medio del pecho
Y solo al cerrar yo los ojos
En cada parpadeo te veo

[Coro]
El álbum de mi cabeza
Solo con fotos tuyas se llena
El álbum de mi cabeza
Solo con fotos tuyas se llena
Una foto de carné
Un afiche en mi pared
El álbum de mi cabeza
Solo con fotos tuyas se llena
El álbum de mi cabeza
Solo con fotos tuyas se llena
Foto en mi cabeza y en mi billetera
(Paisanos latinoamericanos
Los saluda desde Colombia...)

[Verso 2]
En el cuarto oscuro y apartado
Yo revelo y amplifico el pasado
Mientras guarde los negativos
Yo podré reproducirte a mi lado

[Pre-Coro]
Tan ausente y tan presente
Indeleble en mi mente
Impresas tus facciones en mí

[Coro]
El álbum de mi cabeza
Solo con fotos tuyas se llena
El álbum de mi cabeza
Solo con fotos tuyas se llena
Encuadre perfecto
Armoniosa composición
El álbum de mi cabeza
Solo con fotos tuyas se llena
Ay, porque el álbum de mi cabeza
Solo con fotos tuyas se llena
[Puente]
En blanco y negro o en color
Disparan mi emoción
El álbum de mi cabeza
Solo con fotos tuyas se llena
No necesito flash
Aunque sea de noche
Porque no te apagas
Eres de luz, un derroche
El álbum de mi cabeza
Solo con fotos tuyas se llena
Una con un paisaje
Inolvidable viaje
Y esa de cuerpo entero
Firmada con un te quiero
El álbum de mi cabeza
Solo con fotos tuyas se llena"
Ojete Calor,Viejoven,señoritajones,"[Letra de ""Viejoven""]

No sabría si llevarte a un botellón
No sabría si llevarte a Benidorm
Con los yayos
Cuando hiciste la primera comunión
Parecías Baby Jane en camisón
Tus facciones son de mujer mayor
Y me hacen tener ganas de amor
La de Haneke
La ciencia estudiará tu mutación
Le pondrán tu nombre a una infección
Qué bajón

Porque eres viejoven
Eres viejoven
Eres viejoven
Tú eres viejoven

Eres una abuela desde que tenías diez
Y pasasteis de la infancia a la vejez
Tú y Paul McCartney
Ese Lansbury style, el Miss Marple look
Reina madre de paseo por el institut
Pero en vieja

Porque eres viejoven
Eres viejoven
Eres viejoven
Tú eres viejoven

Por dentro cheerleader y por fuera Matusalén
Contradictoria como una rumana parisién
Nonagenaria

Llevas treinta años pareciendo que tienes setenta años
Desde este ángulo estás tan feapa
Tan fea y tan guapa
En tu DNI parecías delgada pero estabas gorda
Delgorda
Cuello fino, cuerpo guitarra
Monstruo, guapa
Y efeba ajada

Porque eres viejoven
Eres viejoven
Eres viejoven
Tú eres viejoven

Porque eres viejoven
Eres viejoven
Eres viejoven
Tú eres viejoven

Viejo, viejo, viejo, viejo
Viejo, viejo, viejo, viejo
Viejo, viejo, viejo, viejo
Viejo, viejo, viejo, viejoven"

[Intro: Alicia Ros]
La sal envolvía mi cuerpo

[Verso 1: Alicia Ros]
Me has dado muchos besos y me sabe todo a sal
Está tirada en tu cuarto, se parece mucho al mar
Tengo arena hasta en los ojos, no me la puedo quitar
¿Quieres venir al sol conmigo? Que me tengo que secar
No voy a vestirme nunca, las cansas me pueden tapar
Quiero vivir en la playa, me conformo con flotar
Solo nado si es contigo, tomo sol en la ciudad
No le entiendo a los vecinos, te espero en la orilla

[Coro: Alicia Ros]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh (Ah)
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verso 2: Alicia Ros]
Me has dado muchos bеsos y me sabe todo a sal
Oigo el ruido dе las olas, me parecen de verdad
Me han salido mil escamas, no me las puedo quitar
Tendré que quedarme en tu cama para poder respirar
Ha llamado la Marina, se empiezan a preocupar
Han pedido mi rescate y no se lo pienso dar
Solo nado si es contigo, tomo sol en la ciudad
No le entiendo a los vecinos, te espero en la orilla

[Puente: Alicia Ros]
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah (Ah)

[Interludio: Alicia Ros]
Con toda la sal y la arena del mundo
Construiré un castillo para que estemos juntos
Pero la marea de la luna llena
Se lo llevará, que no te dé pena

Mumford & Sons,I Will Wait,sgpnovoa,"[Intro]
Well I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

[Verse 1]
But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground

[Chorus]
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

[Verse 2]
So break my step
And relent
Well you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way
Shake the excess

[Chorus]
'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

[Verse 3]
So I'll be bold
As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind, freed from the lies

[Verse 4]
But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground

[Bridge]
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you"

Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

I jumped across for you

I drew a line

Encontraremos algo en el desván

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

[Verse 1]
From the very first time I blessed my eyes on you, girl
My heart says follow through
But I know, now, that I'm way down on your line
But the waitin' feel is fine
So don't treat me like a puppet on a string
Cause I know how to do my thing
Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb
I wanna know when you're gonna come, see

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
Cause if summer is here
I'm still waiting there
Winter is here
And I'm still waiting there

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
Like I said:
It's been three years since I'm knockin' on your door
And I still can knock some more
Cuckoo girl, cuckoo girl, is it feasible?
I wanna know now, for I to knock some more
Ya see, in life I know there's lots of grief
But your love is my relief
Tears in my eyes burn - tears in my eyes burn
While I'm waiting - while I'm waiting for my turn
See!

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love, oh!

Esbe,Darling,rawlins7,"[Verse 1]
Really can't remember where I left my spine
Carryin' my body in a bag for dimes
Hidden in the pages of the New York Times at home
And maybe I'll be better if I take my meds
Ain't a doubleheader if you lose your head
Try the medication that I bought instead
It's workin' for a little, but there's not much left

[Chorus]
Darling, don't you weep
There's a place for me
Somewhere we can sleep
See you in your dreams

[Verse 2]
Ever since a little girl, I found it sweet
Drivin' past a graveyard on a lonesome street
All the little flowers gave me somethin' to believe in
Never knew the feelin' of a stable home
Been a couple years of livin' on the road
Couldn't really tell you where they'd leave a stone
To visit me when I am dead and gone

[Chorus]
Darlin', don't you weep
There's a place for me
Somewhere we can sleep
I'll see you in your dreams
Darlin', don't you cry
Head fast toward the light
Foolish men have tried
But only you have shown me how to love bein' alive
[Bridge]
Until it's time to see the light
I'll make my own with you each night
I'll kidnap all the stars and I will keep them in your eyes
I'll wrap them up in velvet twine
And hang 'em from a fishin' line
So I can see them anytime I like

[Chorus]
Darlin', don't you weep
There's a place for me
Somewhere we can sleep
I'll see you in your dreams
Darlin', don't you cry
Head fast toward the light
Foolish men have tried
But only you have shown me how to love bein' alive"

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

Led Zeppelin,Stairway to Heaven - Remaster,Alex,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

[Chorus]
Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder
[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woahhh

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed, now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

[Chorus]
And it makes me wonder
Ohh, woah

[Verse 5]
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

That's life (That's life), that's what all the people say
You're riding high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June

That's life (That's life), I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

Ya están ahí, los héroes del sábado

Aunque sea por los árboles

Con perspectiva, para ganar claridad

Imposible ser neutral sobre un tren en movimiento
Estas calles son distintas, de aquí no se va el invierno

Van por allí, los héroes del sábado

Somos mirlos en los ojos de otros mirlos que se van

Lágrimas De Sangre,Voy a Celebrarlo,luciammu,"[Verso 1: Neidos]
Y ahora que tenemos tiempo enfadarse no vale la pena, pues
Entre días de guerra hay paz
Y entiendo que tengamos problemas, y el miedo
No deja empatizar
Y si te sientes raro, coge mi mano
Y estarás acompañado
¡Ven a celebrarlo!
Contentos con lo poco que tenemos en esta
Vida no se ensaya jamás
Veinticuatro horas sin un móvil
Las ventanas abiertas y el paisaje inmóvil
Salir y respirar maleza
La humedad de la montaña baña mi alma
Y transpira calma al inspirar
Para nada es fácil estar siempre sonriendo
Pero cerca de los nuestros me medico
Somos diferentes y por eso somos ricos
Amistad entre iguales y en los grupos pequeñitos
Para y mira a tu alrededor; nada nos rodea
No somos el centro, todos damos vueltas
Hasta perder el control, ¡Descarrílate!
El innegable placer cuando nadie te ve
Sosteniendo un libro en el sofá solo en mi casa
Debajo una luz baja o calentándome el café
O en medio de una fiesta bailándola a mi bola
Si nadie me controla así me siento bien

[Estribillo: Microbio]
Me quedo la risa, me sobra la prisa
Me he vuelto a manchar la camisa y voy a celebrarlo
La vida ha puesto alta la música
Y hemos venido a bailar
Me quedo un ratito a mirar tus ojitos
Que huelen como a primavera, y voy a celebrarlo
La luz de tu mirada lúcida
Ha visto la lluvia amainar

[Verso 2: Still Ill]
Nadie dijo que era fácil, ni tampoco barato
La vida es un regalo pero es solo para un rato
Igual que estoy aquí tal vez no estoy mañana
Celebremos la energía que nuestra amalgama emana
Porque me alegro de verte y sé que tu de verme
Ambos nos miramos, celebramos el presente con abrazos
Mirando el Tibidabo a contra luz y desde lejos
Momentos a rememorar de viejos
Momentos que recuerdas en los días de bajón
Que son auténtico jarabe para la cara B del alma
Se reconocerlos en tu cara
Y en cualquiera de esos besos que cesan el retroceso de la calma
Verdadera terapia. Eternas sobremesas aromáticas
Con la mitad de plata y nada que envidiar
Al ocio que fabrica la alienante discoteca
Disfruto mi conciencia y adoro quedarme en babia
¿Callar o darle a la labia? Quizás la opción más sabia
Es bailar en la tarima, según vaya la vaina
No hay nada más bonito para el ánima
Que el brillar de las pupilas cuando la fatiga amaina
Vuélveme a contar aquella historia
Van ochenta veces, pero vértela narrar es pura gloria
Dichosos los momentos donde las almas claman
“¡Abajo los lamentos! ¡Arriba los que aman!”

[Estribillo: Microbio]
Me quedo la risa, me sobra la prisa
Me he vuelto a manchar la camisa y voy a celebrarlo
La vida ha puesto alta la música
Y hemos venido a bailar
Me quedo un ratito a mirar tus ojitos
Que huelen como a primavera, y voy a celebrarlo
La luz de tu mirada lúcida
Ha visto la lluvia amainar

[Interludio: Markus FM]
Estaba lloviendo en mi negro corazón
Entró tu luz y la nube escampó
Estaba viviendo en un negro nubarrón
Llegaste tú y salió el sol

[Verso 3: Microbio]
Me han tratado con una gratitud que no merezco
Por algunas cosas que he escrito en momentos lúcidos
Yo soy un músico que no toca instrumentos
Saber que contigo conecto es un placer súbito
Maitasun gehiegi hain denbora gutxirako
Después del mai me quedaban monosílabos tan solo
Haciendo colegas es, como nos movemos
Si a ti te llega a mi me hace sentir fenómeno
Déjate de prolegómenos
Que no menos de mil horas perdemos discutiendo entre nosotros sobre cómo...
¿Cómo hacer que llegue tanto amor?
En el pecho me nace la necesidad de dártelo
Es un homenaje a todas las pequeñas cosas que nos llenan:
Las risas en la cena, el brindis de verbena
La pena que me da cuando te marchas
Las ganas de fumarme hasta tus tachas, matar la mala racha
Volverme a emborrachar con muchachos y muchachas
Parando por las plazas, pagando a pachas
Callejear, carcajear, armar jarana
Amar a mentes sanas, prender nuestras miserias en la hoguera
Y quemar la cama, locuras de Miguel Noguera, ideas...
Si así eres feliz que así sea
El viento susurra y el mar sisea
Odisea, suena el “shhh...”, como en las olas
Brinda conmigo y abandona tu bajona
A medio camino entre El Masnou y Barcelona
La alegría que te da esa amistad que creías fría y de repente un día te llama...
La duda que no dejas que te coma...
Las damas que han compartido mi alcoba
A alguna le fallé, alguna me gritó en la calle
Con alguna ni follé (fui yo quien no pudo)
Pero le mando besos por si me oye. ¡Un saludo!
Hoy he aprendido a no ser tan ruin
Yo, que me he frustró tan a lo tonto siempre
No hay fin, se que todo se va y todo vuelve
Entre espuma de birra y humo de verde

[Estribillo 2: Microbio]
Derrito mi piedra, mojito y arena
Me fumo un porrito a tu vera y voy a celebrarlo
Comparto contigo mi droga
Por volver a verte vibrar
El amor desahoga, si te hice daño perdona
La libertad nos enamora
Y alguno se ha echado a volar
Oye, que aquí hemos venido a bailar y yo voy a celebrarlo!

[Outro]
Esto me levanta cada mañana
Y ya nada ni nadie me quita las ganas de andar
Yo tengo un alma que todo lo aguanta
Y hasta el alba danza para avanzar
Bebiéndolo a sorbos, buscando mi karma
La playa nos hará de cama y de sábana el mar
Cierro los ojos y estalla la calma
Entre zancadillas empecé a danzar y voy a celebrarlo

[Outro 2: Microbio]
La pena que me da cuando me marcho
Las ganas de volver a veros, Iker, Pablo, Arandia, Jokin, Juantxo
Julen y Jon Altuna, y gritar “¡Askatasuna!”
La vacuna contra el peso de esta cruz a la luz de la luna
Es el placer de veros tocando todos a una
El que tiene un amigo tiene una fortuna!
Y por fortuna tenemos a los Blanks Wutang!
Y una lata de aceitunas!
Y un cóctel con sombrilla!
La vida es una maravilla y te invita a soñar"
Deepend,Woke up in Bangkok,luciammu,"Sometimes I take a left
When everything is right
And I can see the road
When I turn out the light

I sleep under the stars
And then it starts to rain
Take cover in a bar
And run into a friend
And run into a friend
And run into a friend
And run into a friend
Till the sun comes out again

Fell asleep in LA
Woke up in Bangkok
Gave my soul to a babe
In a pawn shop
Oh my ee oh my home
Could be anywhere
And any road, any road
Any road will take me there

Any road, any road, any road

Oh my ee oh my home
And any road, any road
Any road will take me there

I may have roamed these streets
A hundred times before
And when I finally meet you
I'll roam a hundred more

And maybe we'll go North
And maybe we'll go South
Just to keep on rolling, rolling, rolling
Is what it's all about

Fell asleep in LA
Woke up in Bangkok
Gave my soul to a babe
In a pawn shop
Oh my ee oh my home
Could be anywhere
And any road, any road
Any road will take me there

Any road, any road, any road

Oh my ee oh my home
And any road, any road
Any road will take me there

Oh the last thing I remember
Before she broke my heart
We were riding in a rickshaw
Down sunset boulevard
And I asked her where we're going
She said baby don't you care
Any road, any road will take you there

Fell asleep in LA
Woke up in Bangkok
Gave my soul to a babe
In a pawn shop
Oh my ee oh my home
Could be anywhere
And any road, any road
Any road will take me there

Any road, any road, any road

Oh my ee oh my home
And any road, any road
Any road will take me there"
La Maravillosa Orquesta del Alcohol,1932,Jorge,"I never came back where I grew up
This house has been brought down to the ground
So buy me another drink and we’ll see if we can go up there
I’ve got these bruises of a little kid in a little town, in a little town
I never came back where I grew up
I never came back where I grew up"
David Bowie,"""Heroes""",Alex,"[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day

[Verse 1]
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that

[Refrain]
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?

[Verse 2]
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

[Refrain]
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes just for one day

[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us just for one day

[Verse 3]
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (By the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

[Refrain]
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day

[Bridge]
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes

[Outro]
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day"
Wolfmother,Joker And The Thief,Alex,"[Verse 1]
I said the joker is a wanted man
He makes his way all across the land
I see him sifting through the sand
So I'll tell you all the story
'Bout the joker and the thief in the night

He's always laughing in the midst of power
Always living in the final hour
There is always sweet in sour
So we are not goin' home

[Chorus]
Can you see the joker flying over
As she's standing in the field of clover
Watching out everyday?
I wonder what would happen if he took her away

[Verse 2]
What you see well you might not know
You get the feelin' comin' after the glow
The vagabond is moving slow
So I'll tell you all the story
'Bout the joker and the thief in the night

All the people that he see in the night
Hold their dreams up to the light
The wilder beast is searching for sight
And we are not going home

[Chorus]
Can you see the joker flying over
As she's standing in the field of clover
Watching out everyday?
I wonder what would happen if he took her away

[Outro]
I said the joker is a wanted man
Makes his way all across the land
See him sifting through the sand
So I'll tell you all the story 'bout the joker and the thief
I said, I'll tell you the story 'bout the joker and the thief
I said, tell the story 'bout the joker and the thief in the night"
The Rolling Stones,Sympathy For The Devil,Alex,"[Instrumental Intro]
Yow....yow....yow
Huh, huh, huh

[Verse 1]
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Verse 2]
I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, ah yeah

[Verse 3]
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
Well, after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, ah yeah

Oh yeah, get down heavy!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus - Variation]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game, mm yeah
[Verse 4]
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name, mm yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, mmm mean it

[Outro]
Get down
Woo hoo!
Ah yeah, get on down
Oh yeah

Ba bum bum, ba ba bum....

Ah yeah
Tell me, baby, what's my name?
Tell me, honey, can you guess my name?
Tell me, baby, what's my name?
I'll tell you one time, you're to blame
Ooo hoo, ooo hoo, oooo hoo
All right
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo
Ah yeah
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo

Ah yes, what's my name?
Tell me, baby, ah what's my name?
Tell me, sweetie, what's my name?

Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo
Ah yeah
What's my name..."
Jamie N Commons,Rumble And Sway,señoritajones,"[Verse 1]
One look, twice sold, three, four oh the way she looks at me
Held up, let down, she sings me silent melodies
Hair whipped, tight lipped, I've been calling out for you
Cold sweat, once met, can't stand the way she looks at me

[Chorus 1]
Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies
Don't you tell me no truths, just all of your lies
Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies
I'm wailing, so give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies

[Bridge]
Do the rumble and sway
Do the rumble and sway
Do the rumble and sway

[Verse 2]
One look, twice bold, three, four, I'm on my knees for her
Held up, let down, she sings me perfect harmonies
She fakes heart breaks, I'd take just a part of you
Those eyes, sweet lies, I've been drowning out for you
[Chorus 2]
Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies
Don't leave your money at home, just a word to the wise
Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies
I'm wailing so give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies

[Chorus 1]
Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies
Don't you tell me no truths, just all of your lies
Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies
I'm wailing, so give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies

[Chorus 2]
Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies
Don't leave your money at home, just a word to the wise
Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies
I'm wailing so give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies"
WIN WIN,VICTIM,señoritajones,"[Verse 1]
House full of roses
A letter on the stairs
A tape full of messages
For anyone who cares
Collage of broken words
And stories full of tears
Remembering your life
'Cause we wish that you were here

[Verse 2]
Nothing is harder
Than to wake up all alone
Realize it's not okay
It's the end of all you've known
Time keeps passing by
But it seems I'm frozen still
Scars are left behind
But some too deep to feel

[Chorus]
And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime

[Verse 3]
Some days you'll find me
In a place I like to go
Ask questions to myself
'Bout the things I'll never know
What's left to find
'Cause I need a little more
I need a little time
Can we even up the score?

[Chorus]
And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel, tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime
Yeah, whoa, yeah

[Bridge]
And nothing lasts forever
For all good things it's true
I'd rather trade it all
While somehow saving you
It must have been the season
That threw us out of line
Once I stood so tall
Now I'm searching for a sign

So don't need your salvation
With promises unkind
And all the speculation
Save it for another time
'Cause we all need a reason
A reason just to stay
Well, some just can't be bothered
To stick around another day

[Chorus]
And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel, tonight
We've all been victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We've all been victims of a crime

[Post-Chorus]
Victims of a crime
Living with this crime

[Outro]
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you"

Destiny left its mark in the room
It's got me open wide, now I'm waking at noon

How can I forget your presence
When having you around just isn't so pleasant?

[Chorus]
Aquí nunca hay soledad
Mil fantasmas gritan a encalmar

I think we both know, you've noticed it too
It isn't just you and me alone in this room

I'm in love with this modern world
I'm in love with these modern girls

Now I love this German girl

Now I love an Argentinian girl
I used to love this rock and roll world
Now I love this suicide world

Dire Straits,Sultans Of Swing,Julián,"[Verse 1]
You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park, but meantime
South of the river
You stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie
Double four time
You feel alright
When you hear the music ring

[Verse 2]
Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

[Verse 3]
Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

[Verse 4]
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job – he's doing alright
He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing

[Verse 5]
And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole

[Guitar Solo - 3:20-4:13]

[Verse 6]
And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
""Goodnight, now it's time to go home""
Then he makes it fast
With one more thing
""We are the Sultans –
We are the Sultans of Swing""

Morcheeba,Rome Wasn't Built in a Day,Julián,"You and me we're meant to be
Walking free in harmony
One fine day we'll fly away
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day, hey hey hey

In this day and age it's so easy to stress
'Cause people are strange and you can never second guess
In order to love child we got to be strong
I'm caught in the crossfire; why can't we get along?

'Cause you and me we're meant to be
Walking free in harmony
One fine day we'll fly away
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day

I'm having a daydream, we're getting somewhere
I'm kissing your lips and running fingers through your hair
I'm as nervous as you 'bout making it right
Though we know we were wrong, we can't give up the fight
Oh no

'Cause you and me we're meant to be
Walking free in harmony
One fine day we'll run away
Don't you know that Rome wasn't built in a day
You and me we're meant to be

[Verse 1]
Went to a dance last Saturday night
I was feeling tipsy, the mood was right
Sight a little daughter and a steppin' out the corner
'Cause I feel like dancing all night

[Chorus]
But I said, cool down the pace for me little woman
You're dubing it too fast for me
Cool down the pace for me, little woman
That's not how it should be

[Verse 2]
I told her to try, I dont know why
No use trying 'cause she can't
And, so, she do it how she want

[Chorus]
So I said, cool down the pace for me, little woman
You're rocking it too fast for me
Cool down the pace for me, little woman
That's not how it should be
You're rocking too fast for me
[Verse 3]
Said she would try
But she just don't know why
She keep on trying, but she can't
And, so, she do it how she want (Yeah)

[Chorus]
But I beg her, cool down the pace for me, little woman
You're dubing it too fast for me
I said to cool down the pace for me, little woman
That's not how it should be

Please, sister, try
I don't know why
No use trying 'cause you can't
And, so, she do it how she want (Yeah)

Cool down, cool down, cool down
Not so fast
All night this dance will last
Don't be no haste
Just cool down the pace"

Half as much as I do

[Verso 1]
Somos culpables de este amor escandaloso
Que el fuego mismo de pasión alimentó
Que en el remanso de la noche impostergable
Nos avergüenza seguir sintiéndolo

Poco a poco fuimos volviéndonos locos
Y ese vapor de nuestro amor
Nos embriagó con su licor
Y culpo al carnaval interminable
Nos hizo confundir, irresponsables

Si fuimos carne de la intriga casquivana
Que la imprudencia del rumor hoy desató
Y descubiertos por la luz de la mañana
Nos castigaron la desidia y el dolor

Y ese vapor de nuestro amor
Nos embriagó con su licor
