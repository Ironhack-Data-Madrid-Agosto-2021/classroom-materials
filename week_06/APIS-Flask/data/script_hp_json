Lucky we didn't panic."},{"scene":27,"character_name":"Harry Potter","dialogue":"Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology."},{"scene":27,"character_name":"Hermione Granger","dialogue":"What is that?"},{"scene":27,"character_name":"Harry Potter","dialogue":"I don't know. Sounds like wings."},{"scene":28,"character_name":"Hermione Granger","dialogue":"Curious. I've never seen birds like these."},{"scene":28,"character_name":"Harry Potter","dialogue":"They're not birds. They're keys.

Strange."},{"scene":28,"character_name":"Ron Weasley","dialogue":"Alohomora! Well, it was worth a try."},{"scene":28,"character_name":"Hermione Granger","dialogue":"Eugh! What are we going to do? There must be a thousand keys up there."},{"scene":28,"character_name":"Ron Weasley","dialogue":"We want a big, old-fashioned one.

The one with the broken wing!"},{"scene":28,"character_name":"Hermione Granger","dialogue":"What's wrong, Harry?"},{"scene":28,"character_name":"Harry Potter","dialogue":"It's too simple."},{"scene":28,"character_name":"Ron Weasley","dialogue":"Oh go on Harry!

We've got to play our way across the room. All right, Harry, you take the empty bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the queen-side castle.

Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone.

See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket. Stop him! Don't be a fool. Why suffer an horrific death, when you can join me, and live."},{"scene":31,"character_name":"Harry Potter","dialogue":"Never!"},{"scene":31,"character_name":"Voldemort","dialogue":"Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again, together? We can bring them back. All I ask is for something in return. That's it, Harry.

They're both just fine."},{"scene":32,"character_name":"Harry Potter","dialogue":"But what happened to the Stone?"},{"scene":32,"character_name":"Albus Dumbledore","dialogue":"Relax, dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed.

You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that is saying something."},{"scene":32,"character_name":"Harry Potter","dialogue":"Does that mean, with the Stone gone, that is, that Voldemort can never come back?"},{"scene":32,"character_name":"Albus Dumbledore","dialogue":"Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin."},{"scene":32,"character_name":"Harry Potter","dialogue":"What is it?"},{"scene":32,"character_name":"Albus Dumbledore","dialogue":"Love, Harry, love. Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I'm afraid I have lost my liking for them.
