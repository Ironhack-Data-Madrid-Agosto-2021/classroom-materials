    "Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "GIT is a VCS system designed with the following goals in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple design\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)\n",

    "* Fully distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "* Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)\n",

    "\n",
    "* A **Graph** is a way to model connected things. More technically, a graph is a collection of \"nodes\" connected by \"edges\". Think for example of a social network, where individuals are the nodes and relationships are the \"edges\" (a.k.a. links).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Acyclic** means that the graph contains no circles. This means that you cannot find a path where you start and finish on the same node following the direction of the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Directed** means that the edges can only go in one direction. Think for example of \"parent\", \"child\", and the relationship \"is son of\" --- nope, you cannot be parent and child of the same person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **graph as a whole** contains a [project's history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuRd_Eneuk8). \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nodes** in Git represent commits (remember: snapshots of your project). \n",
    "\n",
    "* The **edges** point from a commit to its parents. \n",

    "* A **merge** occurs when a commit has more than one parent. \n",

    "- `repository` | `repo` : storage location for a software package (\"a folder with git monitoring\")\n",
    "- `untracked` : a file or directory not monitored by git, does not belong to the repo\n",
    "- `tracked` : a file git was instructed to monitor (through the `add` command.)\n",
    "- `commit` : a point on the temporal line of a repository. A \"snapshot\" of all the changes we \"made official\", or the last state of staged files before we commited.\n",
    "Every commit has a unique id and must have a commit message. The more descriptive the message, the better.\n",
    "- `local repo` : A repository of code on the computer you are currently using\n",
    "- `remote` : A repository on a different machine (e.g.: Github)\n",
    "- `forking a repo` : creating an alternative timeline for a repo, usually someones repo we want to have a copy of our own.\n",
    "- `cloning a repo` : making a local copy of a remote repo\n",
    "- `push` : sending the changes from local repo to a remote.\n",
    "- `pull` : bringing changes of a remote repo to a local one\n",
    "- `.gitignore` : text file with files/folders we do not want git to track or ask about.\n",

    "- `branch` : the different `timelines` of a repository. It allows for parallel development. \n",
    "- `merge` : joining the changes of a branch into another. It is the opposite of forking, instead of separating, it unites two \"timelines\"\n",
    "- `pull request` : the act of asking the owner of a repository to merge the changes on your fork/branch. It is literally the request for him to `pull` your changes."
